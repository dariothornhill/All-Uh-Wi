          <h1>About us</h1>
          <p>
            <span>Alluhwi Comics</span> is the Caribbean’s first mobile platform
            for amazing comic books and graphic novels of all genres, from
            creators in the region and the diaspora. Our main goal is to make it
            easier to read Caribbean comics for the millions of fans here in the
            region, the near diaspora and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            What does easier mean? Greater accessibility and affordability.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means a subscription-oriented model where for the average price
            of a single comic book, fans get monthly à la carte access to the
            best titles from the Caribbean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Easier means a mobile platform that lets fans enjoy fantastic
            regional comics wherever they are, however they like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alluhwi Comics also makes it easier for our creators by lowering the
            barriers to entry for Caribbean comic creators of all levels,
            connecting them with fans, and developing a model for attractive
            compensation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name “Alluhwi” is a blend of the familiar Caribbean phrase “all
            of we”, and represents our desire: to bring together comic book
            creators, both those living in the region and outside, and the
            legions of casual and dedicated lovers of comic books.
          </p>
          <p>
            This digital platform is the brainchild of Marc R. D. Gibson. Marc
            has been serious about comic books since the age of ten years old.
            Together with fellow comic book fans Reshaud, Kadeem, and Adriel,
            who just happen to be web and mobile developers, we introduce a new
            way to read Caribbean comics.
