      <h1 class="terms">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
      <p class="terms">By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make
        sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app,
        any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of
        the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
        app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related
        to it, still belong to Bolt from the Blue Entertainment.</p>

      <p class="terms"> Bolt from the Blue Entertainment is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
        services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it
        very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

      <p class="terms">The Alluhwi Comics app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order
        to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
        recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
        and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
        malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Alluhwi
        Comics app won’t work properly or at all.</p>

      <p class="terms">You should be aware that there are certain things that Bolt from the Blue Entertainment will not
        take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
        connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Bolt from the Blue
        Entertainment cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access
        to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

      <p class="terms">If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
        agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
        provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party
        charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges
        if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you
        have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>

      <p class="terms">Along the same lines, Bolt from the Blue Entertainment cannot always take responsibility for the
        way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
        you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Bolt from the Blue Entertainment cannot accept responsibility.</p>

      <p class="terms">With respect to Bolt from the Blue Entertainment’s responsibility for your use of the app, when
        you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
        correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available
        to you. Bolt from the Blue Entertainment accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience
        as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

      <p class="terms">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
        requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may
        change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Bolt from the Blue
        Entertainment does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works
        with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates
        to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
        at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a)
        the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
        delete it from your device.</p>
      <h3 class="terms">Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h3>
      <p class="terms">We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this
        page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on
        this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page</p>
